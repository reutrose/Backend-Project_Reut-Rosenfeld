### Environment Variables

âš  **IMPORTANT:** Before running the project, make sure you add the **.env** file to the root folder. If the `.env` file is missing, the project will **not** work correctly.

If you are the examiner, please check the **assignment submission** where a `.zip` folder is provided. Inside, you will find the `.env` file that needs to be placed in the **main folder** before starting the server.

### Running the Project

#### Development Mode (local MongoDB):

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Production Mode (MongoDB Atlas):

```sh
npm start
```

### Initial Data

When the server starts, a function automatically checks whether the database is empty. If it is, **mock data** will be injected for testing purposes.

- Default user credentials (including passwords) are stored in the `.env` file.
- If the `.env` file is missing, the **initial data will NOT be generated**.
